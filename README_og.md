- Added Player Positioning 
  - Regular - Normal Player Positioning (scaled with screen width)
  - 4:3 - for modfiles that expect the player to be in a 4:3 aspect ratio position (hidden for 4:3 and might also screw up some modfiles) 
  - Centered
- Much better widescreen support (removed hardcoded values)
- Fixed custom mods (JudgeSkin, etc.) only applying to one player and also being reset randomly.
- Judgements can be easily added by putting them in the __Judgements__ folder (Taken From Constant-Melody-X) (Only for NITG)
