GrooveNights - StarUndrscre's fork
============
This is a modified version of a slighty older version of Altracer42's GrooveNights for NotITG fork, inspired by (Oat and Rya's Simply Love fork)[https://github.com/oatmealine/simply-love-oat-fork/].

Added features:
- Restart game and reload songs through options menu (found in Options menu)
- New select play mode videos
- New death screen (star plush jumpscare)
- Removal of "Tournament mode" text

TODO:
- Make banners fit into 418x164 and not cropped (i have attempted this and it turns out i do not have the mental capacity to do it)
